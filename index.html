    <div id="costly-consequences-of-underinformed-directors"
    class="section level1">
    <h1>Costly consequences of underinformed directors</h1>
    <p>How many corporations exist with directors responsible for
    protecting a large portion of stakeholders’ equity typically having
    so little applicable experience or knowledge of their duties or
    legal responsibilities?</p>
    <p>We have all seen and read about consequences of failed governance
    of community associations — from petty irritations of hapless
    administration of architectural rules preventing a homeowner from
    flying a flag, to devastation of a community and lost lives
    resulting from failure to conduct structural inspections and
    maintain adequate reserves.</p>
    <p>HOA managers and attorneys too often witness the dearth of
    volunteers and the inordinate costs in time and funds wasted by HOA
    Boards attempting to navigate issues affected by laws and best
    practices about which directors are unaware — and time and costs for
    recovering from consequences of actions or inaction.</p>
    <div id="pool-of-qualified-candidates-varies-with-community-size"
    class="section level2">
    <h2>Pool of qualified candidates varies with community size</h2>
    <p><div id='fig_1' style='float:right; margin-right:0px; margin-left:auto; padding: 14.4px 0px 14.4px 14.4px ; width:50%; '><div style='width:90%; margin:auto; text-align:left; padding-bottom:14.4px'><span style='font-family:; font-style:plain; font-size:medium; '><span style='font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; '></span>Pool of qualified candidates varies with community size</span></div><img src='images-md/availability-curve-500.png' width='100%'/></div></p>
    <p>Populations of most towns and cities usually are sufficient to
    enable competitive elections and town- and city-councils with
    talents in disciplines applicable to operating their governments.
    However, the comparatively small population of most homeowners
    associations often means a dearth of board candidates, many without
    applicable qualifications. Often, HOA boards find themselves with
    directors with virtually <em>no experience</em> in business,
    finance, insurance, law, construction or many other applicable
    fields.</p>
    </div>
    <div
    id="hoas-with-underqualified-directors-are-the-rule-not-the-exception"
    class="section level2">
    <h2>HOAs with underqualified directors are the rule — not the
    exception</h2>
    <p>HOA boards with under-qualified directors can have profound,
    negative and costly effects on the lives of their members.</p>
    <p>In my over forty-years of experience with HOAs I’ve found
    well-meaning volunteers in a neighborhood setting tend to conduct
    meetings within a social context wherein decisions are heavily
    influenced by uninformed sensibilities and impulses of neighbors
    present, without due diligence and investigation, consideration of
    state regulation or standards of governance intended to protect
    broader interests.</p>
    </div>
    <div
    id="mere-availability-of-director-education-hasnt-been-sufficient"
    class="section level2">
    <h2>Mere availability of director education hasn’t been
    sufficient</h2>
    <p>Even if a well-trained volunteer is elected and advocates for
    established best practices and legal compliance, such informed
    advice is often disregarded with deference given to an opposing
    director’s longevity or assertiveness, or to expedience or politics.
    Statutes and case law may as well not exist unless <em>multiple</em>
    directors are aware of them. Often, only when a <em>second</em>
    director reinforces and validates a director’s advice as deriving
    from an authoritative source, does the dynamic change; only then are
    directors apt to heed the advice.</p>
    <p>To improve board performance in community associations, we must
    find a way to increase community association members’ participation
    on boards and ensure broader exposure of directors to best
    practices, statutes and case law.</p>
    <p>Certification to an established baseline of knowledge and
    continuing education to maintain minimum standards is mandated in
    Business and Professions code for attorneys, physicians, real estate
    professionals and a myriad of other vocations with the potential to
    affect consumers’ welfare. HOA directors also may profoundly affect
    HOA members’ interests. Even so, while performance requirements
    exist, education requirements making directors aware of them are
    conspicuously absent.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="conventional-licensing-could-hobble-recruitment"
    class="section level1">
    <h1>Conventional licensing could hobble recruitment</h1>
    <p>Consider this argument against making director education
    compulsory through legislation to require licensing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“HOA directors are volunteers and many HOAs have difficulty
    recruiting sufficient volunteers for their boards. An increased
    burden of required education or certification may dissuade potential
    volunteers, further exacerbating recruitment.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>At least one state, Florida, did try a licensing model.</p>
    <div id="a-flawed-model" class="section level2">
    <h2>A flawed model</h2>
    <p>We can learn from the Florida model, which loosely follows
    consumer protection licensing requirements, ostensibly requiring
    training to minimum standards. However, presumably to address the
    objection that licensing would discourage potential volunteers, the
    legislature created what I believe to be a fatal loophole that
    effectively nullifies the program’s purpose: A would-be director may
    circumvent training or passing an exam simply by indicating in
    writing to the secretary they have read the governing documents and
    agree to uphold them.</p>
    <p>While this may have been a compromise to enable bill passage,
    foreseeably it could be fatal to the purpose of informed
    governance.</p>
    <p><em>With a twist on the licensing model, we can do
    better.</em><a name="incent-education"></a></p>

    <p>I propose we create model legislation giving legislatures in each
    state guidance and a head start in crafting bills that would enable
    this program to <em>incent members to participate on their
    associations’ boards, and to seek to educate themselves</em> as
    directors and for boards to encourage directors’ education. (See <a
    href="#summary_of_state_legislation"><em>Summary of state
    legislation required to enable program</em></a>.)</p>
    <p>I propose that CAI (Community Associations Institute), ECHO
    (Educational Community of HOA Homeowners), and other community
    association-oriented education institutions advocate for such
    legislation.</p>
    <p>First, legislation would create a new law (in the case of
    California, Civil Code Section 6200 to Division 4, Part 5, Chapter
    12) that would</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>enable establishing a public-facing non-profit corporation,
    for example, the <em>Board of Certification for Community
    Association Directors</em> (BCCAD), to establish and administer the
    program described herein.</p></li>
    <li><p>create the credential for community association members,
    <em>Certified Community Association Director</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p>enable such an organization to administer tests and grant
    certifications to common interest community members who meet
    standards of knowledge of best practices and basic legal
    requirements for governance of state community
    associations.</p></li>
    <li><p>enable maintenance of certification records and making such
    records publicly accessible.</p></li>
    <li><p>authorize such organization to coordinate with the Secretary
    of State to enable key linkage with their community association
    database records to facilitate records maintenance and avoid
    unnecessary duplication.</p></li>
    <li><p>enable the organization to employ such records to create a
    community association <abbr>COMPETENCE</abbr> rating system derived
    principally by the proportion of its directors with current
    certifications, frequency of structural inspections and how reserves
    are funded, and whether the board has committed to training and
    legal oversight. See a list of <a
    href="#star_rating_determination">parameters</a> affecting
    successful governance.</p></li>
    <li><p>require an annual disclosure to members of the Board’s
    <abbr>COMPETENCE</abbr> rating.</p></li>
    <li><p>require adherence to a code of ethics and standards of
    practice for community association directors.</p></li>

    directors with current certifications, frequency of structural
    inspections and how well reserves are funded, whether the board has
    committed to training and legal oversight, and whether it is
    actively managed by a manager certified as provided by the state. It
    would foster an environment wherein communities with higher ratings
    may garner favored insurance premiums and prestige of being
    identified by the state as being in the top-10, top-100,
    top-1000.</p>
    <div id="potential-for-lower-dues" class="section level3">
    <h3>Potential for lower dues</h3>
    <p>Insurance premiums typically are one of the largest budget items
    affecting monthly dues. Insurance companies would be incented to
    offer reduced premiums to those community associations that maintain
    a certain rating as risk management would be part of the BCCAD
    certification curriculum and exam. And reduced premiums translating
    into lower dues may be a powerful incentive for community
    associations to participate.</p>

    <h3>The <abbr>COMPETENCE</abbr> training program</h3>
    <p>The training program overseen by BCCAD would be known as the

    <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>P</strong>rinciples
    <strong>E</strong>ducation <strong>T</strong>o

    Education</em></a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> method.</p>
    <p>The state would not <em>require</em> community association
    directors to participate in the <abbr>COMPETENCE<abbr> training or
    to be licensed; thus, community associations may continue to operate
    as they have without fear of a requirement that might discourage
    members from volunteering. However…</p>
    <p>There would be incentives for those associations that encourage
    their directors to participate and become <em>certified</em>. (See
    <a href="#multiple-benefits"><em>Multiple broad
    benefits</em></a>.)</p>
    <p>The program would allow <em>any</em> association member of a
    residential common interest development to attain a
    <em>certification</em> as Certified Community Association Director
    by passing an examination on essential rudiments of CID oversight.
    Certification would be maintained by accumulating continuing
    education credits.</p>
    <p>This would ensure consistency with legal requirements (for
    California, Civil Code § 5105-a-3) that any association member be
    eligible for candidacy and provides equal footing for non-directors
    to attain certification that may affect perceived qualifications as
    board candidates.</p>
    <p>Any member’s certification status under this program would be
    verifiable via a website, as for verification of licenses and
    certifications for professionals and service providers (for
    California, those operating under Department of Consumer Affairs
    regulation). m_line</p>

    <p>Benefits described below — particularly those involving reduced
    costs for the association affecting dues — may motivate CID boards
    to press directors to engage in the program and maintain their
    certifications and association ratings that would merit such
    benefits. Thus, association members may be motivated to vote for
    those candidates who are certified to maintain qualifying status and
    thus help control dues.</p>

    <p>An overall board COMPETENCE score or <em>rating</em> would be
    calculated for each community association, derived primarily from
    the frequency of structural inspections, percentage of funding of
    reserves, proportion of directors who are certified, proportion of
    directors’ seats that are filled, whether they have engaged a
    manager who is certified, have engaged an attorney specialist and
    have committed to continuing education. (See <a
    href="#star_rating_determination"><em>Determination of community
    association COMPETENCE star rating</em></a>.</p>
    <p>The BCCAD would maintain a list of the top-10, top-100, top-1000
    community associations by rating. Real estate values in communities
    who can boast such ratings may benefit and provide a strong
    incentive for members to keep electing candidates who are certified.
    This also should incent directors and members to keep their
    association’s rating high to enhance property values.</p>
    <p>Disclosure of the board’s rating would be required in the annual
    policy statement provided to all members (in the case of California,
    pursuant to Civil Code §5310), also ensuring prospective purchasers
    would receive it. (See <a href="#example_bios">example candidate

    class="section level3">
    <h3>Benefits for community association insurers</h3>
    <p>Insurance companies have long recognized the value of training of
    customers in improving risk management and reducing casualty costs.
    This program should result in more directors with demonstrated
    knowledge of best practices, current law and awareness of principles
    of risk management. An informed Board should be less likely to
    neglect structural inspections, under-fund reserves, fall askew of
    the law and incur unexpected legal expenses or special assessments.
    As such education could lower risk and insurance premiums —
    <em>typically one of the biggest budget items for CIDs</em> — this
    could provide a compelling motivation for boards to promote
    education among their directors and make certified candidates more
    attractive to the dues-paying members.</p>
    <p>The BCCAD could work with insurance providers to demonstrate how
    such a program could reduce risks and encourage offers of discounts
    on premiums for those associations that can maintain a certain
    rating.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="benefits-for-candidates" class="section level3">
    <h3>Benefits for candidates</h3>
    <p>Indicating certification status on ballots and election materials
    with candidate lists — with a <em><abbr>CCAD<abbr></em> designation
    or simple asterisk and footnote — would be an indicator of a
    candidate’s commitment to improve knowledge of best practices and
    legal requirements. For associations where elections are
    competitive, this could influence members in their voting and
    increase overall board competence.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="benefits-for-management-companies" class="section level3">
    <h3>Benefits for management companies</h3>
    <p>The program should strongly incent management companies to ensure
    all of its managers are certified. This is because an association’s
    <abbr>COMPETENCE</abbr> rating will be affected by whether its
    manager — If it has one — is certified. (See the calculation for an
    Association’s rating under <a
    href="#star_rating_determination"><em>Determination of board of
    directors COMPETENCE star rating</em></a>.)</p>
    <p>Faced with competing bids from two management companies — one who
    will provide a CACM-certified manager that will increase the board’s
    rating, and one that cannot — which will they select?</p>
    <p>Much of a manager’s time may be spent advising directors and
    dealing with issues that would not have surfaced had directors been
    better informed. This program should help with such education.</p>
    <p>Management companies may discover such benefits sufficient to
    warrant offering a discount for boards that can maintain higher
    ratings or increasing management fees should the board’s rating drop
    below a certain number. Management fees usually are one of the
    largest budget items affecting dues.</p>

    <p>Should we succeed in having legislation passed to create the
    BCCAD, community association education organizations likely would
    see a substantial increase in membership. Those already at the

    their established prominence and reputations for excellence.</p>

    <div id="may-help-bootstrap-volunteer-recruitment"
    class="section level3">
    <h3>May help bootstrap volunteer recruitment</h3>
    <p>As legislation would mandate publishing of the board’s rating and
    the certification status of candidates, association members should
    become increasingly aware of the potential cost of insufficient
    participation on the board by qualified directors and the effect of
    directors’ education on dues, likely to induce increased
    participation.</p>

    <p>Also, the need and techniques for recruitment, training,
    motivation and retention of volunteers should be part of directors’
    education within this program. Thus, while it may be naïve to
    anticipate director education will completely solve recruitment
    issues, my experience has shown that awareness of the need for such
    activities has made a difference in both quantity and qualifications
    of volunteers.</p>

    <h3>Would save time and help keep directors on the same page</h3>
    <p>An inordinate amount of time in meetings is spent debating
    directors’ lay opinions regarding how issues should be treated, when
    applicable regulation and proven best practices already exist.</p>
    <p>I suspect almost anyone who has attended association board
    meetings over time can relate anecdotes reflective of this. I
    attended a meeting where an influential senior director argued
    against seeking legal advice regarding a potential liability,
    rationalizing a consultation would be pointless because “there will
    always be another attorney with a different opinion.” She boasted
    that, while she had been president, “we <em>never</em> got legal
    advice” — as if that should be the board’s policy. Her argument
    prevailed, reinforced by a new board president who declined to heed
    a statute called to her attention, responding “I’m not an attorney
    and I won’t interpret the law.”</p>
    <p>Had even a couple of directors been in exposed to rudiments of
    risk management, I believe this would not have occurred. Such
    exposure would be part of the training and certification
    process.</p>

    <div id="may-help-freshen-board-composition" class="section level3">
    <h3>May help freshen board composition</h3>
    <p>Many boards have one or more directors who have remained
    year-after-year having exhibited no effort to inform themselves
    regarding directors’ obligations. For no other reason beyond
    longevity, perceived seniority or force of personality, they
    continue to maintain strong, if underinformed, influence. If
    directors and members do invest in education under this program,
    theoretically, continued tenure of underinformed directors may
    become less likely, raising overall board competence.</p>

    <p>Director testing requirements are modeled somewhat after

    Interest Development Manager Criteria. However, whereas testing for
    manager certification represents an opportunity for vocational and
    income advancement, testing for volunteers’ certification has the
    potential to be a barrier for essential director recruitment —
    already difficult for many community associations. Therefore,
    requirements for director certification are reduced from those for
    manager.</p>

    <p>The number of questions and required percentage of correct
    answers would be determined by BCCAD, the objective being to ensure
    knowledge of fundamentals while not discouraging participation by
    unpaid volunteers. The policy may be adjusted over time as results
    are gauged and as required to meet this objective. An example policy
    might be the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Initial certification would require correctly answering, for
    example, 40 of 50 questions in an exam, <em>open-book</em> to
    encourage review of any material about which the applicant may be
    uncertain. There might be a one-week time limit for
    completion.</p></li>
    <li><p>A failed exam may be taken over until successful, with a
    minimum 24-hour waiting period to encourage review of training
    materials. Multiple versions of the certification exam may be
    prepared and used to allow for repeat testing, discourage
    <em>teaching the test</em> and better ensure a fair assessment of
    knowledge.</p></li>
    <li><p>Classes and presentations may precede the online exam,
    however, a candidate also may learn through alternative means more
    accommodating for a working adult, such as articles, books and
    online courses.</p></li>
    <li><p>Upon successful completion, certification status would be
    recorded into the database, accessible online. The applicant would
    be notified by e-mail and a PDF certificate generated for optional
    download.</p></li>

    <h2>Maintaining certification</h2>
    <p>An example policy for maintaining certification might be the
    following:</p>
    <p>To maintain certification, one must accumulate a minimum of eight
    continuing education credits (CECs) every four years from date of
    initial certification. At least 50% of those credits must derive
    from material covering state law or legal topics, authored or
    approved by an attorney practicing CID law in the state.</p>

    strives to achieve a balance of incenting meaningful education
    without overly burdensome requirements that may discourage volunteer
    recruitment. We also recognize individuals’ learning styles vary and
    allow for this in awarding certification and continuing education
    through these methods:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Formal in-person classes — Attending in-person
    BCCAD-qualifying classes or presentations offered by institutions

    <h1>Determination of community association <abbr>COMPETENCE</abbr>
    star rating</h1>
    <p>Whereas a calculated numeric score or rating may require
    interpretation, ratings based upon the popular and ubiquitous
    five-star model have come to be immediately and intuitively
    recognized. An eminently recognizable <em>star rating</em> next to
    the association’s name may incentivize an effort by its directors to
    increase its rating by ensuring all positions are filled and
    directors’ receive training — the primary objectives of this
    program. Directors informing association members how the rating may
    affect dues may heighten members’ awareness of the importance of
    volunteering for board participation.</p>
    <p>The rating calculation includes normalization to a maximum of
    five for presentation in the five-star format, e.g., a rating of 2.9
    would be presented as</p>
    <p><div id='fig_8' style='margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; padding: 14.4px 0px 14.4px 0px ; width:170px; '><img src='images-md/2-9-stars-500.png' width='100%'/></div></p>
    <p>A board’s COMPETENCE rating would be determined by a formula that
    may be adjusted by BCCAD from time to time as relevant factors
    become apparent. Factors to be integrated into the rating formula
    include those most heavily associated with a healthy community.</p>
    <p>The initial formula is as follows:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[ rating = (RP * .01) + FP +
    (\frac{Number\ of\ currently\ certified\ directors\ and\
    manager}{Max\ directors\ per\ Bylaws}* \frac{Actual\ number\ of\
    directors}{Max\ directors\ per\ Bylaws} * 3)
    \]</span> …where RP is Reserves Percent funded and FP is the
    Foundational Partners credit. (See below.)</p>
    <p><a name="percent_funded_explan"></a></p>
    <div id="rp-reserves-percent-funded" class="section level3">
    <h3>RP: Reserves percent funded</h3>
    <p>Community Associations Institute (CAI) defines reserves percent
    funded as “The ratio, at a particular point in time related to the
    fiscal year end, of the actual (or projected) reserve balance to the
    fully funded balance, expressed as a percentage.” Generally, percent
    funded is a gauge of how well the association has anticipated
    infrastructure repairs and replacement require-ments and assessed
    members so as to accumulate amounts sufficient to cover such costs
    without additional funding or special assessments.</p>
    <p>The state must pass legislation to require community associations
    to engage a professional engineering firm every three-to-five years
    to physically inspect physical infrastructure, determine estimated
    remaining life, projected repair and replacement costs, and specify
    a dollar amount that must be contributed on a regular basis in order
    for such funds to be available when needed. The topic is discussed
    more fully in the CAI publication, <a
    href="https://www.caionline.org/LearningCenter/credentials/Documents/RS%20Designation%20National%20Reserve%20Study%20Standards.pdf">National
    Reserve Study Standards</a>.</p>
    <div id="formula-may-be-amended" class="section level4">
    <h4>Formula may be amended</h4>
    <p>The proposed formula above gives substantial weight — an entire
    star — to sufficiency of structural inspections, reserves studies
    and funding. The measure for funding adequacy used in the formula is
    <em>reserves percent funded.</em> However, not all associations use
    the funding model for which <em>percent funded</em> is appropriate
    to gauge funding sufficiency.</p>
    <p>The <a
    href="https://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/re25.pdf">California DRE
    <em>Reserve Study Guidelines for Homeowner Association
    Budgets</em></a> describes the following three reserves funding
    stratagies:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Fully Funded Model — setting a Reserve funding goal of
    keeping the Reserves at or near 100% funded. <em>Reserves percent
    funded</em> indicates how well the reserves are funded.</p></li>
    <li><p>Threshold Funded Model — setting a Reserve funding goal of
    keeping the Reserve balance above some threshold. Depending on the
    mix of common area major components this model may be more or less
    conservative than the fully funded model. The only way to tell is to
    compare the two models closely.</p></li>
    <li><p>Baseline Funded Model — “Minimum Funded Model - setting a
    reserve funding goal of keeping the reserve cash balance at the end
    of each year in the overall reserve funding projection at or above
    $0.”</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, the above proposed formula may be amended to
    accommodate the alternative strategies.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="fp-foundational-partners-credit" class="section level3">
    <h3>FP: Foundational Partners credit</h3>
    <p><em>FP</em> is the <em>foundational partners</em> credit and
    credits the association with having established the two key
    relationships essential to directors’ education and informed
    decision-making:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>membership in a community association educational institution
    approved by BCCAD, such as CAI (Community Associations Institute) or
    ECHO (Educational Community of Homeowners). A current membership in
    either organization is equal to one-half-point (0.5), the limit for
    this credit even with membership in more than one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A qualifying educational institution will periodically provide
    directors with published magazines and/or newsletters containing
    articles on community association law and best practices in
    management and oversight.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>an attorney specializing in state community association law.
    Certifying to BCCAD the association has established a client
    relationship with such an attorney will credit the association with
    one-half-point (0.5), the limit for this credit even if a
    relationship with more than one exists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no minimum required number of consultations per year to
    retain this portion of the FP credit. However, communities are
    reminded to seek a consultation as circumstances warrent. Should a
    court or arbiter of binding arbitration issue a ruling against a
    community association on a liability issue, the association would
    lose the entire FP credit for a period of two years from the most
    recent adverse ruling.</p>
    <p>Unsophisticated directors believing they were saving money by
    avoiding legal consultations is a common occurrence. Potential for
    substantial losses involving members’ interests mandates a
    continuing relationship with an attorney specialist and this is
    reflected within the rating system.</p>

    <p>Success in incenting participation and education for informed
    governance is predicated upon universal applicability of COMPETENCE
    ratings. Were application of ratings merely elective, there would be
    little incentive for community associations to maintain ratings.
    Therefore, legislation would be required that would do <em>all of
    the following</em>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>require community associations to engage a professional
    engineering firm every two-to-five years to physically inspect
    physical infrastructure, determine estimated remaining life,
    projected repair and replacement costs, and specify a dollar amount
    that must be contributed on a regular basis in order for such funds
    to be available when needed. The report also must calculate the
    percent funded. The topic is discussed more fully in the CAI
    publication, <a
